## probability distribution 

Instead of keeping the actual data samples, we want to fit it into a model. Such as turning continuious values into discreet ones.
Or fitting it into a parametric probability distribution.
Such as the gaussian distribution with 2 parameters, the mean mu $\mu$ and the spread around the mean: the standard deviation sigma $\sigma$. Alternatively the variance: $\sigma^2$ can be stored.
