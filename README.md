## todo

- [ ] explore graph tool library of networks
- [ ] indepth reading/ notes of stochastic block model papers
  

## daily progression

### monday 5th july

Familiarization with the project:
- installation of graph-tool library
- documentation overview 
- first read of main papers outline in the cookbook 

### tuesday 6th july

- project github repository setup

Experimenting with graph-tool:
- went through the quick start tutorial, learning the base library functionality and terminology

### wednesday 7th july

In preparation of an indepth reading of the Nonparametric statistical inference and stochastic block model, I refreshed my understanding of basic probabilities along with numpy and matplotlib to help with visualisation.

studied the community chapter of network theory up to section 9.5
